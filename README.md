## Wsg Guys!
I guess this is my first repo so I'm gonna talk a bit about myself.
I currently studying computer science with the intent of getting into sysadmin. I barely know anything about networking, and I know I still have a lot to learn, but I'm excited to learn.

## Here are some goals I'm aiming for in the mean time:
-Learn some C++ before I begin that course
-Create a home entertainment server that could hold and stream downloaded media (Integrate TMDB down the line)
-Implement OpenGuard for DNS blocking with a raspberry pi.
